Read on!  We are looking for seasoned Business Intelligence Engineers to join a BI team in the AWS Support organization. AWS Support, despite the impression that its name (“support”) might give you, is not a typical reactive customer service, but an independent AWS business that provides industry-leading offerings way beyond just “break-fix”. The business has a self-standing P&L and has even yielded revenue larger than most AWS Services. Managing an organization that provides support for ever-expanding AWS product portfolio to millions of customers across the globe is not a simple task and leaders in all functions inevitably need reliable data for their day-to-day operations and strategic decision-makings. The BI team is an integrated core part of the AWS Support operations delivering robust and trustworthy infrastructure to the truly data-driven organization.

You will let the data answer questions such as “What is high/low quality means at support?”, “Is this particular customer happy with their support experience? “, and “How productive is this support agent versus other agents in the network?” The usage of the data that the AWS Support BI team publishes spans to other AWS teams outside of the organization. Support data serves as one of key leading indicators for new customer demands and for problems yet to be discovered. Such external usage might lead to “next big thing” launched by AWS!  From technology perspectives, you will have opportunities to (and will be asked to) be exposed to the modern agile cloud-based data technologies. The team will be empowered to select the right technology, if necessary, based on customer needs and you will have the full set of AWS services in your toolbox.  We are open to hiring candidates to work out of one of the following locations:  Sydney, NSW, AUS   Strong desire to understand your customers Experience working directly with business stakeholders to translate between data and business needs Excellent data presentation skills Excellent written and verbal communication skills Ability and will to quickly and continuously learn new technologies Strong passion and will for automation Experience in operations management Understanding in basic computer/network security concept  Acknowledgement of country: In the spirit of reconciliation Amazon acknowledges the Traditional Custodians of country throughout Australia and their connections to land, sea and community.
