Mutinex,Data Scientist (MMM specialist),Sydney,"$116,846",1 to 50 Employees,--,Company - Private,--,--,Unknown / Non-Applicable,"This is a specialist role for a Senior + (Senior, Staff or Principal) Data Scientist who has experience deploying, feature engineering and building data requirements with MMM (Marketing/Media Mix Models) in markets outside of Australia. You will spearhead the global expansion of our model outside of Australia into global markets. You'll work alongside our growing team of amazing Data Scientists, learning state of the art Bayesian and Time Series techniques. This role can be based in Sydney or Melbourne where we have offices in both cities and have a hybrid way of working. The role You'll be responsible for levelling up our efficiency and process, working alongside our Data Science and Marketing Science teams to make sure we institutionalise and automate our process to handle different global markets. Then you will also contribute to the design of our generalised model with our RnD team, proactively designing solutions for issues that may arise in new markets and capturing each market’s uniqueness in data. What we are looking for It's a short but simple list of requirements we're looking for in this position: 1 + years Experience conducting MMM with a global provider outside of AU as a Data Scientist.   That paired with strong Data Science fundamentals, so you'll be at a Senior level as well. You don't have to have built the MMM model but we are looking for someone who has been part of an international MMM process; deploying, feature engineering and defining data requirements.  About Mutinex We might be an early stage startup but we already have strong product market fit, household name clients (Samsung, Mars, CUB and ING to name a few) and millions in revenue.  Being early stage means we're also still pretty scrappy and you wouldn't be coming into a well oiled machine, yet. But you would get a lot of opportunity to design, build and oil the machine until it's super oily.  We aren't aiming to be another Tech Unicorn because Unicorns aren't real. We are aiming (and confident of being) more like a real and really big animal that lives for a long time, like a Bowhead Whale.  Mutinex is a startup B2B SaaS platform that provides in-depth data analytics for marketers to better understand their ROI and make better decisions with future spend. Founded in Australia, we've hit millions in ARR & have seed funding ($5 million in May 2023 & $9.5 million in October 2023 backed by EVP) that we'll use for growing our team to continue to improve our product, bring in new customers and enable them to make better and more informed decisions.  We have a hybrid work environment with teams in Sydney, Melbourne and expanding into the US.  With a team of around 50 people we value high quality communication, strong opinions that are held loosely and people who can give and take feedback well.  Equity (ESOP) is offered to all staff on top of their salary and we also offer additional annual leave after 1 year of tenure (from 20 to 25 days a year) that continues to grow another day each year of service until you max out at 30 days per year.Show moreReport"

Application infrastructure is hosted on AWS, and Cloudflare protects from DDoS attacks. Mindhive is currently engaged in several initiatives: Transitioning our AWS environment to “infrastructure as code” based on Terraform. We are taking advantage of this transition to introduce improvements - e.g., streamline updates, agility to plug in AWS smarts, etc. We are working towards ISO 27001 compliance. This exercise has prompted sustainability initiatives, including the one above. Code is in BitBucket with CI/CD pipelines. When our “infrastructure as code” initiative is complete, the entire Mindhive stack should be able to be recreated at the push of a button. Also, the application Yeah-Nah is coded in Flutter and AWS-Amplify, providing a segue-way for the organisation to move into smartphone apps. Python developers write test cases into the Python code. We currently use Kubernetes. However, this has proven a little complex for a small team to manage so the new Terraform-based environment won’t be using it. Serverless: We already have our toe in the water here (AWS Amplify, two helper functions to do with scanning downloads for malware) and anticipate moving further in that direction when appropriate. Development environment on developer’s workstations (using Docker). Staging and Production on AWS. Use Datadog and Sentry for logging and monitoring. User authentication against Auth0.

AE Studio4.0 ★,Data Scientist (Brain-Computer Interface Team),Remote,,51 to 200 Employees,2016,Company - Private,Internet & Web Services,Information Technology,Unknown / Non-Applicable,"Are you a data scientist who is excited about brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that increase human agency? Are you a self-starter who is comfortable with ambiguity and wants to tackle challenging engineering problems? Do you want to work with a world-class remote team while having a big impact on the machine-learning approach for an early-stage project?  We are looking for a Data Scientist who is interested in working with us at AE Studio on the future of neurotechnology!  About AE Studio  AE Studio is a mid-sized startup from California. We have a team of highly skilled developers, designers, and data scientists building products that increase human agency. We use the most recent technologies to develop solutions for startups as well as large companies like Samsung and Berkshire Hathaway. We have an awesome work environment and a highly productive process.  One of AE Studio’s core missions is to develop brain-computer interface technologies that increase human agency. We are looking for someone with experience in data engineering, strong problem-solving skills, self-management skills, and enthusiasm to learn more about the intersection of data science and neuroscience.  About the Role  You will work on building deep learning models for neural decoding (classification or regression models with neurodata input). You will first learn the details of a variety of brain recording technologies (experience with multimodal brain recordings is a plus!), and help discover what type of model architectures work consistently across data types and decoding tasks (experience with transfer learning is a plus!). You will collaborate with our international BCI team, in addition to outside academic and industry organizations, in a semi-autonomous research role as we work together to develop an operating system for BCI applications.  You: Have a master’s degree (or equivalent) in a relevant field (e.g. neuroscience, electrical engineering, physics, or mathematics) Are fluent with Python and experienced with Jupyter notebooks Have experience in at least one of the following: neuroscience, BCI experimentation and neural signal processing Have experience with working with deep learning libraries such as tensorflow or pytorch Please include a link to your public code repository (e.g. GitHub) in your application Bonus Points For: A PhD (or equivalent) in a relevant field (e.g. neuroscience, electrical engineering, physics, or mathematics) Experience with Python software development and/or data engineering Experience using AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, databases, IAM, etc) Experience with real-time systems What do you get out of it?? Opportunity to work on world-changing technology Collaborative & friendly remote work environment (we're all nice ) Good pay Reasonable & flexible work hours Yearly retreat bringing together our teams from across the world  We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.   Equity  Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.  At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.  Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.  We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity. Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.  Location Australia (remote)Show moreReport"

Deakin University4.3 ★,PhD Scholarship in Developing Solid Electrolytes using Machine Learning,Burwood,"$33,500",1001 to 5000 Employees,1974,College / University,Colleges & Universities,Education,$500 million to $1 billion (USD),"A scholarship is available at the Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM), Deakin University. This project will develop solid electrolytes using combined machine learning (ML), molecular modelling, and experimental characterisation methods. We are looking for applications from enthusiastic candidates.[PhD project description]Project title: Machine Learning-assisted Development of Highly Functional Organic Ionic Plastic Crystals for Solid-state BatteriesBackground: Safe, long-lasting, and high-performance rechargeable batteries are required to meet the ever- growing demand for battery-driven worldwide electrification. Due to the safety issue of current lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), this project will aim at developing solid electrolytes that could help address the safety concerns in the next generation of batteries. Here a novel class of solid electrolytes, named organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) will be explored using combined ML, molecular simulations, and experimental characterisation approaches. The outcome will contribute to the new OIPC development, thereby increasing opportunities to use OIPCs for solid-state battery (SSB) applications. It is also expected to generate novel knowledge to fill gaps in this frontier research area, which may lead to breakthrough results.Project details: The project has three stages: (1) Dataset collection which involves both experimental and simulation data, (2) Training of ML models and making predictions and (3) Experimental validation and further computational investigation. Special attention is paid to the development of OIPCs, which are emerging soft solid electrolytes for SSBs, but they have yet to be studied strategically using ML. In Stage1, the research data will be collected from the previous publications (>50 papers) describing the physicochemical properties of OIPCs. For some results not reported but could be obtained computationally, additional computation will be conducted to fill gaps. In Stage 2, using this dataset, the correlation among several properties, such as OIPC crystalline phase structures, ionic conductivity, electrochemical potential window, thermal behaviour, and ionic interactions will be analysed via ML methods. The trained model then will be used to predict the properties of a few pre-known systems for validation. Then the validatedML methods will be used to predict new OIPCs with potentially promising properties. In Stage 3, the synthetic routes of selected new OIPCs will be designed and prepared with the help of the synthesis team.The predicted properties of these OIPCs will be confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, the most promisingOIPC will be investigated computationally to give further in-depth understanding at an atomistic level.The project will be supervised by the IFM’s leading researchers in the battery field, Dr Hiroyuki Ueda,Dr Fangfang Chen, Prof. Jenny Pringle, and Prof. Patrick Howlett. The project will start in early- or mid-2024 and last for 3 years.[Requirements for Candidates]You must be able to demonstrate:Master’s degree or a first honours degree (H1 actual, ideally Grade Point Average, GPA of ≥85%) in science, material science or engineering, material physics, chemistry, or related fields (which must have been awarded by the starting date of the PhD)The ability of data analysis, scientific writing, and presentations.

The research will be conducted in Dr Arash Zamyadi’s group (within Environmental and Public Health Microbiology Laboratories, Living Lab) in the Department of Civil Engineering, in collaboration with other research groups at Monash, national research institutes and overseas, and Australian water industry including Melbourne Water and Water Research Australia.  Assessment of water and wastewater treatment efficacy will require extensive analysis of microbial viability and microbial quantification/taxonomic identification. Cell viability assessment capabilities will require development of fluorescence-based methods. Novel quantification/identification capabilities will be developed using automated analysis with cell imagery, flow cytometry and artificial intelligence for large scale testing at target treatment trains (including but not limited to treatment technologies that manage algal blooms). This project hypothesises that a supervised and knowledge-guided machine learning approach can be used to identify microbes accurately and rapidly within manufactured water samples using different analytical platforms (optical microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and imaging flow cytometry). The PhD project objectives are to explore (1) fluorescence-based approaches for determining microbial viability and activity in water and wastewater, and (2) machine learning approaches for quantifying and identifying microorganisms.  A strong background in environmental microbiology, experience in using fluorescence-based methods, and flow cytometry is essential. Additional experience in cell imagery, coding and artificial intelligence is required. Applicants must show excellent communication and inter-personal skills, and the ability to conduct self-motivated research. They should have research-based Honours or Masters Degree (or equivalent) in the relevant research areas and have a record of publishing their research in mainstream scientific journals.
